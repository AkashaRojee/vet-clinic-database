# Vet Clinic Database

This project contains the SQL commands used for building a relational database for a vet clinic scenario, as part of Microverse projects.

Things done so far:

1. Set up initial data structure

- Create database `vet_clinic`
- Create table `animals`
- Insert data into table
- Query data

2. Execute transactions and query data using aggregate functions

- Use database transactions
- Use aggregate functions for more complex queries

3. Query multiple tables

- Add foreign keys to model 1-many relationships
- Query data using JOIN

4. Add join tables

- Add join tables to model many-many relationships
- Query data from all tables

## Technologies Used

PostgreSQL

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
